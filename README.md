## PYTHON PRACTICALS

1. WAP to find the roots of a quadratic equation

2. WAP to accept a number 'n' and
- Check if 'n' is prime
- Generate all prime numbers till 'n' 
- Generate first 'n' prime numbers
This program may be done using functions

3. WAP to create a pyramid of the character "*" and a reverse pyramid

4. WAP that accepts a character and performs the following:
   
 - print whether the character is a letter or numeric digit or a special character
 - if the character is a letter, print whether the letter is uppercase or lowercase
 - if the character is a numeric digit, prints its name in text (e.g., if input is 9, output is NINE)

5. WAP to perform the following operations on a string :-  
   
 - Find the frequency of a character in a string.
 - Replace a character by another character in a string.
 - Remove the first occurrence of a character from a string.
 - Remove all occurrences of a character from a string.

6. WAP to swap the first n characters of two strings.

7. Write a function that accepts two strings and returns the indices of all the occurrences of the second string in the first string as a list. If the second string is not present in the first string then it should return -1.

8. WAP to create a list of the cubes of only the even integers appearing in the input list (may have elements of other types also) using the following:

## OPERATING SYSTEM

1. Write a program (using fork() and/or exec() commands) where parent and child execute: 
- same program, same code. 
- same program, different code. 
- before terminating, the parent waits for the child to finish its task.
2. Write a program to report behaviour of Linux kernel including kernel version, CPU type and 
model. (CPU information)
3. Write a program to report behaviour of Linux kernel including information on 19 configured 
memory, amount of free and used memory. (memory information)
4. Write a program to print file details including owner access permissions, file access time, 
where file name is given as argument.
5. Write a program to copy files using system calls.
6. Write a program to implement FCFS scheduling algorithm.
7. Write a program to implement Round Robin scheduling algorithm.
8. Write a program to implement SJF scheduling algorithm.
9. Write a program to implement non-preemptive priority based scheduling algorithm.
10. Write a program to implement preemptive priority based scheduling algorithm.
11. Write a program to implement SRJF scheduling algorithm.
12. Write a program to calculate sum of n numbers using thread library.
13. Write a program to implement first-fit, best-fit and worst-fit allocation strategies.
